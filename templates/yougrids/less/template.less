/* 
	DEFAULT TEMPLATE LESS
	THERE IS NOTHING YOU NEED TO DO HERE 
	lessphp compiler is modifyed to compile all your @import "file.css" 
	files also. Meaning that if in any of your css files 
	you have @import "file.css" or  @import "file.less" it will be recompiled within template.css file
	This way you can just go head and change your default css file the way 
	you did before. If you want to add some LESS vars or any custom LESS/CSS code
	including @import "somefile.less";
	please use templates/TEMPLATE_NAME/css/custom.css file.
	Activate custom.css file must be set to YES in template admin.
